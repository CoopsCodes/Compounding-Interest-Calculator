This project is intended to teach me how to build a Compounding interest calculator, in VanillaJS using the DOM model.

There wont be a need for a database as there'll be no storage needed.

MVP is a working calculator that takes and interest rate, ammount and time-frame to calculate total compounding interest.
Beast Mode will be if i could use an API to pull in interest rates from banks and calculate the best rate of the day.
Beast Mode ++ would be to create a log in screen and add local storage so people could create profiles and keep track of their savings, no email addresses, just a username and passwords to avoid privacy issues


Compounding Interest calculation
A = P(1 + r/n)nt  **nt after the brackets is to a power**
using Math.pow i can calculate the power of the principal.

A = Accrued Amount (principal + interest)
P = Principal Amount
I = Interest Amount
R = Annual Nominal Interest Rate in percent
r = Annual Nominal Interest Rate as a decimal
r = R/100
t = Time Involved in years, 0.5 years is calculated as 6 months, etc.
n = number of compounding periods per unit t; at the END of each period
